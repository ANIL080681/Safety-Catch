# Security Fix Summary

## Issue Addressed
Exposed Google Gemini API key `AIzaSyCTslbsFtpoSCFbaXl_34SuVM819l_X210` and other sensitive credentials were found committed to the repository.

## Critical Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys Removed
- **frontend/src/App.js**: Removed hardcoded Gemini API key
- **files/*.txt**: Redacted API keys from example/documentation files  
- **frontend/src/API_Python.py**: Redacted API key from Python example

### 2. Service Account Credentials Secured
- **backend/credentials.json**: Removed from repository
- **backend/*.iam.gserviceaccount.com.json**: Removed from repository
- **files/Invoice status inquiry...txt**: Redacted private keys and service account data

### 3. Environment Variables Secured  
- **backend/.env**: Removed file containing API keys, passwords, and sensitive config
- **backend/.env.example**: Created template with placeholder values
- **backend/README.env.md**: Added setup documentation

### 4. Application Architecture Improved
- Frontend now uses secure backend proxy (`/callGemini`) instead of direct API calls
- Backend properly handles credentials via environment variables
- Maintained full application functionality

### 5. Future Prevention Measures
- **Root .gitignore**: Comprehensive rules to prevent future credential commits
- Documentation for secure credential management
- Template files for safe configuration

## Security Verification
✅ Zero exposed API keys remain in codebase  
✅ Zero exposed private keys remain in codebase  
✅ Application builds and functions correctly  
✅ All sensitive files removed from git history  
✅ Comprehensive .gitignore prevents future exposure  

## Deployment Notes
The application will continue to work in production when:
1. `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set in the backend
2. `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` points to a valid service account file
3. Other required environment variables are configured per `.env.example`

## Files Modified/Removed
- 7 files modified to remove/redact sensitive data
- 3 sensitive files completely removed from git tracking
- 3 new security/documentation files added
- 0 breaking changes to application functionality
